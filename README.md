# Laravel For Beginners
Learn The Essential Concepts of PHP, Laravel &amp; Linux To Launch A New Career.

## Description
Learn the incredibly popular and in demand Laravel framework. There are countless Laravel courses in the world; here's what makes this one unique:

* No assumptions that you already understand the PHP language.

* No assumptions that you already understand the "Model View Controller" pattern.

* No assumptions that you already understand how to setup a dev environment on your computer.

* No assumptions that you already understand how to deploy a website.

* No assumptions that you already understand the Linux command-line.

Laravel is an amazing framework, but because it is so feature-complete I've noticed that a lot of guides and tutorials get overly ambitious and introduce 10 or 20 new concepts in a single lesson which is frustrating when you're a beginner and you're trying to actually understand why you're doing what you're doing. I've also noticed a lot of tutorials assume you've already used lots of other web application frameworks before Laravel, and so they don't actually explain any of the organizational or conceptual pieces of the puzzle.

This course is different because I assume that Laravel is the first web application framework you've ever attempted to learn, and so we move at a pace where you can actually absorb the big-picture concepts that exist in all frameworks; not just Laravel.

Here's what we'll learn in the course:

* The PHP language itself

* Getting our computer ready for Laravel

* User registration, log in, log out

* Profile Photo Upload (server-side resize & storage)

* The Blade Template Engine

* Composer the PHP Dependency Manager

* Form Validation

* Gates, Policies, Permissions (e.g. You can only edit your own posts and not other people's posts)

* Relationships; letting one user follow another user

* How to use Models to query for the exact data you want (e.g. homepage feed of posts from the users you follow)

* How to send automated emails from your app

* Add API URLS that allow users to login and create & delete posts from outside the context of a web browser

* Use Docker to practice deploying to a Linux server

* Configure a real public Ubuntu VPS to host our Laravel app with a real domain



* Setup our VPS as a Git server that you can push to for effortless future updates to your live site
